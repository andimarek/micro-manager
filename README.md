### Overview

Especially in the Microservice architecture you end up with a bunch of different repositories and projects for one product.
And because they all should be loosely coupled there is often no "natural" place to document and to interact with all of them at the same time. micro-manager lives exactly at this meta-level: it knows all projects and can answer questions and execute tasks concerning several of them.
